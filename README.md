# Tasks: 01 Basic Operators

## Task description

Here are several small tasks. Each of them is located in their own js files.

### evalExpr.js

Given k (number). Evaluate the expression: 4 \* (2k - 1)



### volumeCone.js

Given height h and radius r of a cone. Evaluate [volume of a cone](https://www.cuemath.com/measurement/volume-of-cone/).

### divider.js

Given number n and number k. Find the whole part and the remainder of the integer division of n by k. Return a string formatted "wholePart remainder" with one space symbol between two wholePart number and remainder number.

### digitsSum.js

Given number n (0 <= n <= 1000000). Create a function that counts sum of all digits

### backToFront.js

Copy and paste defined amount of a string's symbols to the front and back of a string

### compareSalary.js

Compare three salaries and find the difference between the max and the min

### compareTwoNumbers.js

Compare two numbers and output a string ">" if the first the greater than the second, "=" if they are equal or required math operator otherwise. All possible strings: "<", ">", "=", "<=", ">="

### sumInRange.js

Find a sum in a range of consecutive numbers

### sumTwoNumbers.js

Find a sum of two numbers

## How to run tasks locally

The following commands are useful to run your code locally

### Run all tasks at once

`npm run test:local` - iterates throught all `src/*.js` files and test your solutions

### Run a certain task

You could specify a name of each individual task to run that locally

`npm run test:local:backToFront` - run test cases only for `backToFront` task
`npm run test:local:sum` - run test cases only for `sum` task

A list of available commands is specified in `package.json` file in `scripts` section

## Commit message rules

Please follow `Commit message rules` instructions provided on `main` branch.

## Evaluation criterias - max 10 points

If a task passes all of its test cases, then it gives its maximum points assigned for that task

- backToFront: 1 point(s)
- compareSalary: 1 point(s)
- compareTwoNumbers: 1 point(s)
- digitsSum: 2 point(s)
- divider: 1 point(s)
- evalExpr: 1 point(s)
- sumInRange: 1 point(s)
- sumTwoNumbers: 1 point(s)
- volumeCone: 1 point(s)
